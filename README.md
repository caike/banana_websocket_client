# Banana Websocket Client

🍌🍌🍌

This is a fork of [sanmiguel/websocket_client](https://github.com/sanmiguel/websocket_client) that's been modified to fit the needs of the [Xogmios library](https://github.com/wowica/xogmios)

Due to the way Hex.pm works, using Github references as source for a library's dependency will not allow it to be published as a package:

> $ mix hex.publish
>
> ** (Mix) Stopping package build due to errors.
> Dependencies excluded from the package (only Hex packages can be dependencies): banana_websocket_client

For this reason, this fork is being re-published as a new Hex package.
